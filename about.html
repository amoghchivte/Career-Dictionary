                    Choosing the right course after 10th and 12th is extremely important decision that students have to take. It is important because the right course after 12th can lead to rewarding career right after completion or may become a basis for post-graduation course. It is also a difficult decision because there are so many good options which are available these days but we do not know which is good for us. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are some factors that we must consider to choose the best course after 12th and the first step is to know what course options are available. Here we are trying to show you various available courses after 12th after every stream i.e. Science, Commerce and Arts.

                <h1>Objectives of Arts</h1>
                <p>

                    The arts represent an outlet of expression, that is usually influenced by culture and which in turn helps to change culture. As such, the arts are a physical manifestation of the internal creative impulse. Major constituents of the arts include literature – including poetry, novels and short stories, and epics; performing arts – among them music, dance, and theatre; culinary arts such as baking, chocolatiering, and winemaking; media arts like photography and cinematography, and visual arts – including drawing, painting, ceramics, and sculpting. Some art forms combine a visual element with performance (e.g. film) and the written word (e.g. comics).
                </p>
                <p>
                    With a background in Arts, one can pursue career options such as teaching, nursing, social work, law, politics, business, television, radio artist, content writing, acting, designing, singing and many more.

                <h1>Objectives of Science</h1>
                <p>
                    Can you imagine a world without science? You wouldn’t have to worry about being late to work or finding your car keys because, well, jobs and cars wouldn’t exist. You would be living in a cave or a rudimentary built shelter, at best, wondering whether you’ll be able to hunt something for your next meal, or get killed and become some wild animal’s next feast in the process. The moment that early humans decided to take action into securing their survival marked the birth of science, as that’s the moment when they started asking themselves two vital questions about the world surrounding them: “How?” and “Why?”.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In modern usage "science" most often refers to a way of pursuing knowledge, not only the knowledge itself. In the 17th and 18th centuries scientists increasingly sought to formulate knowledge in terms of laws of nature. Over the course of the 19th century, the word "science" became increasingly associated with the scientific method itself, as a disciplined way to study the natural world, including physics, chemistry, geology and biology. It is in the 19th century also that the term scientist began to be applied to those who sought knowledge and understanding of nature.
