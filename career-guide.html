            <h1>How to choose a career or course after School?</h1>

            <div class="col-md-8">
            <ol>
                <li><span class='subheader'>First Step:</span> If you have some career preference, good. But if you have no clue what you want to pursue, that&#39;s OK. Don&#39;t panic but take a calculated decision rather than blindly following what your parents or friends suggest. Employers look for well-rounded people who can solve problems for them. Most important thing is to study whatever you like and develop problem solving skills in the process.</li>
                <li><span class="subheader">But how to decide:</span> Analyze the following three decision making parameters:</li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>LOVE: Choose a field/career where your &#39;Interest&#39; is. What you Love to do for many years.</li>
                        <li>SKILLS: You need to have the right skills to perform the job well. Analyze your strengths.</li>
                        <li>DEMAND: Just focusing on LOVE and SKILLS may not lead to good career. There should be high &#39;demand&#39; for your chosen area and skills.</li>
                    </ol>
                <li>Don&#39;t know what you love or want to do?</li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Ok. It&#39;s not necessary to start by defining what you &#39;Love&#39;. In fact, start from any of the above three parameters and try filling the other two. Example: You may identify your skills first, then analyze the demand in the market by studying job openings and then decide your interested area of Love. Or you may start by identifying the &#39;demand&#39; and then figure out the other two parameters.</li>
                        <li>Ideally, the intersection of above three parameters will be the best career option for you. Example: You may Love Math or doing number crunching, your Mathematics scores are fantastic and you may explore &#39;Analytics&#39; where demand is high and good math skills are needed, then you can opt for the commerce field.</li>
                    </ol>
                <li>Suddenly faced with so many new course names after school?</li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>A student may face new course names like Botany, Zoology, Geology, Microbiology, Civil, Political Science, and many more. It&#39;s important to briefly understand what is taught in the course you are exploring and sample nature of job opportunities after that graduation course.</li>
                        <li>Avoid courses that put major emphasis on subject areas that you do not like.</li>
                    </ol>
                <li>Still clueless on what to do after school?</li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Explore change of career. Click here (http://www.infolona.com/career_and_education/after_school/science/find) for vocational career options.</li>
                        <li>Bright students may opt for IAS, IPS, etc.</li>
                        <li>You can also join Armed Forces (Army, Navy or Airforce).</li>
                        <li>If confused, shortlist couple of career options. Apply in relevant courses/exams and then take admission based on where you qualify. But always choose &#39;course&#39; over &#39;college&#39;. In other words, choose the &#39;course&#39; that best fits your career aspiration. There is no point in taking admission in a top college but in a course which you do not like.</li>
                        <li>Or else, take a graduation course which you like and decide during graduation. This way, you can also pursue post-graduation options like MBA or MCA.</li>
                        <li>Prefer taking a course which is closer to your residence to avoid commute time and maximize time for studies, extra-curricular activities.</li>
